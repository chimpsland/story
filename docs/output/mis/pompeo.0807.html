I commend the participants of the Loya Jirga as they gather to consolidate national support for peace in Afghanistan. After 40 years of war, bloodshed, and destruction, the parties are ready to embark on a political process to reach a negotiated settlement.

Today, the U.S. imposed financial sanctions on a network of smugglers contributing to instability in Libya and depriving the Libyan people of economic resources. We will continue to take concrete actions in response to those who undermine Libya’s peace, security, or stability.
