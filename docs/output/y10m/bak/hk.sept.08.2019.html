<h1>Hong Kong police beat their citizens to US Consulate General</h1>
<p>They Beat people into riot, send thugs to make riot,
it's today's Hong Kong police.</p>
<p>There is approved peaceful assembly  today in charter Garden, Hong Kong, Sept. 8, 2019.</p>
<p>Citizens come and walk to USA Embassy, US Consulate General, 
they want it pass the bill tomorrow in the US Congress, 
Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, 
which might be the release of the prolonged struggle against CCP and local police.
After 3 monthes protests, 
over 1100 arrested and thousands painfully beaten with batons.</p>
<p>It's not going to happen as citizens wished in an new born police control city.</p>
<p>When thousands people walking along the road, 
police with full gear give them hard pressure. At 1645, 
the peaceful assembly forced to stop. </p>
<p>Citizens all know police and thugs will destroy the assembly and prevent a big
event of a million citizens show up in streets.<br>
They don't know how hard Hong Kong police can push it.</p>
<p>It's well determined on LIHKG.COM, Telegram groups, 
citizen would do everything to make it peaceful. 
So, who stir up riot is thugs in action.</p>
<p>1603pm, police shut down MTR Station Central by saying 3 people using laser pointer to them.
About 1600pm, police block road preventing people to walk to US Consulate General.
They start block public traffics to the US buildings,
thus they produce a good number of citizens trapped and start to declear them illegal assembly.
What a shameful dead. 
They set up kill zones to arrest more.</p>
<p>Then, thugs start to stir up things in MTR subway station Central.</p>
<p>1800pm, they stir up another in MTR Admiralty. 
They use the whole MTR subway system to scare people from an peaceful assembly.</p>
<p>1900pm Popo start to shoot tear gas at exit of MTR Station Causway Bay, 
And finally popo successfully push it to the claimed police attacked by rioters.</p>
<p>This prevent a million people come to streets to show their disdain of corrupted Hong Kong police.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Hong Kong police, 
you hardworking and beating your fellow citizens successfully make it a big thing,
Hong Kong people want it in the US Congress: 
Hong Kong Human rights and Democracy Act.</p>
<p>When Trump charge your boss billions after billion US dollars as tariff,
your double faced job as thugs plus riot police get you hundreds USD per hour worthy.
Hold you baton, mask your face, beat them as riot police or as thug,
double your enjoyment.</p>
