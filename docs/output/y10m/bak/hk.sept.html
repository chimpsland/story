<p>Animal like dogs or chimpanzees don't know the beauty of music.
I can show you by all the human history, they don't know it.</p>
<p>You get terribly beaten up like animals, you don't deserve it. 
But, you lost over 850 brothers and sisters, and you have no weapon, 
you should know that you get little chance to equip yourself same weapons as those chimps.</p>
<p>If you trust me, the music is your real weapon.</p>
<p>I know a lot of human history, I can tell you: 
Only our human beens know art.</p>
<p>Go to the international airport, where chimps dare not kill you,
sing the song, it's your weapon. Help people, don't trouble them, sing the song.</p>
<p>You'd get no weapon over policemen, 
they beat you in name of protecting citizens,
force them to protect their own family, 
Hong Kong is a city no policeman get escape,
use it as your advantages. 
I tell you not to revenge, 
God give no rights for the righteous people to get his/her own revenge,
but you need teach those small dogs, 
you share a city without escape，
especially for policemen.</p>
<p>sing the song, NOW, you get no weapon over chimps.

<h1>The song</h1>
<p>I made an awkward translation of the song. I am not good at it,
let me repeat it: <em>I am not good at the type of the job</em>, 
Just want it be the first step to let you know you need put some effort in the job.
Please find some one to make a real good English version, 
if you want your heart been heard, 
sing it in your friend's language.</p>
<p>When you get the painful beating from riot police, 
I do want you to know you are trapped to get the beating,
they are evil and smart.</p>
<p>How to win like humane?</p>
<p>You can corner an animal when you sing your song together.</p>
<p>Trust me, it's how our ancestors win those powerful animals.</p>
<p>I said it not because I am a muscian, 
but because I know some anthropology,
I know how ancient people got safe when they come across beasts.</p>

<hr>
<p>By the way, how a christian would feel when he see the phrase:</p>
<p>O ye ......</p>
<p>It's a good bible phrase, with a pet sense of humor, 
and it can be used to tottle against a friend. 
KJV, Luke 12:28:</p>
<p>If then God so clothe the grass, 
which is to day in the field, 
and to morrow is cast into the oven; 
how much more will he clothe you, 
O ye of little faith?</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>What's different between Freedom and Liberty</p>
<p>Liberty is somehow could be viewed as hardworkings to get freedom.
In another words, it's the not free part of the freedom.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Who can do the good translation? 
You need some one who know musics, the Cantonese style of pronouncing,
and the syllables. 
Better he/she know the bible, because of the nature of the music.</p>
<p>And at last, Forgive me my stupid attempts, I know you fight day and night.</p>
<p>God bless you.</p>
<h1>LIGHK VERSION</h1>
<p>Oh why is this land brought to tears?
Oh why are our folks brought to rage?
We lift high our heads, we will not be hushed
Liberty please come back here!</p>
<p>Oh why has this land filled with fear?
Oh how has our faith kept us strong?
Oh how has blood shed but we keep marching on?
For a bright and free Hong Kong!</p>
<p>Stars fall down in this dark night of fear
But beyond the haze we hear this trumpet sound:
“All come here! Defend liberty, against tyranny!
With lasting wit and bravery!”</p>
<p>Oh dawn has come, Hong Kong shall be set free
Oh friends of Truth, fight for change right now and here! (we have claimed victory)
Democracy, liberty ever these we pray
Glorious Hong Kong ever be!</p>
<h1>banon video</h1>
<p>The west doesn't want another Tiananmen massacre.
Trump challenge it with humane fashion, it means he's ready for all possible fashions.
UN is a step behind USA.
UK is busy on Brexit from UN.
And CCP will think:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>not tiananmen style = no army = humane fashion
</code></pre></div>

<p>So we are going to see all of the things come to Hong Kong people: 
maffias in blue, triads in white, 
policemen in full gear, international passengers from CCP,
covered agents, elite soliders in field training,
social scientists in protest organization.</p>
<p>They all come and enjoy the highly paid worry-free crimes,
raping, beating, dispearing, arrests, tortures, suffocation.</p>
<p>The only concern is how to control all the player outside finance institutions in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>After it, every one is going to respond as they would. 
All the countries, nations, unions and states know how to say it.</p>
<p>CCP then ask Trump: Is this no-Tiananmen fashion?</p>
<p>They can start to play human rights game as next round of game.
It's playable because every one can benefit from it, 
only Hong Kong  at stake. 
They all think they are smart until CCP overtake USA and leave no one to save UN or UK.</p>
<p>So, Hong Kong people get no escape but a real dog fight in the international
city.  Tactically, It's a good chance to fight. See, not only the big brother
is watching you, but the whole world is watching.</p>
<p>God bless Hong Kong people</p>
<h1>Magnitsky Act</h1>
<p>Several European countries, Canada, and the European Parliament passed bills
imposing sanctions on Russian officials implicated in Sergei Magnitsky’s death.
Recently, several countries have expanded their sanctions regimes to include
human rights abusers from any country. On February 21, the United Kingdom
passed its own version of the Global Magnitsky Act. Estonia passed a similar
law in 2016. The Canadian Parliament and European Parliament are both
considering bills to target international human rights violators.</p>
