</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h1>Hong Kong is getting 2 big markets</h1>
<p>Hong Kong get chance to become a great city,
The city can fulfil its history accomplishment: 
a port between the west and the east.
This can happen only if Hong Kong protesters can hold on,
but it's hard to keep energy after prolonged 4 months when 1500 arrested already.</p>
<p>And if we talk about business, 
Hong Kong will get good share in the 2 markets,
the mainland and the west. if they sucessed, 
they are going to get far more market share than before,
no need to say benefits of culture and political advantages.
This is quite different view when most citizen witness a lot
infrasture damage caused by frontline black fighters.</p>
<p>In history, Hong Kong is a port. It became important after Opium war of 1840,
when British became the first naval power after Napoleonic war in Europe,
when the dynasty of Qing failed to talk with the west.</p>
<p>Now, it's a same chance. CCP can't keep in good relationship with the west,
Hong Kong fight for it's autonomy. The extradition bill is only a fuse,
the real struggle is against infiltration of CCP. 
So, if keep inside 1 country 2 system, 
Hong Kong should fight for full autonomy,
it's to control their government work for their own citizen,
and keep rule of law.</p>
<p>If break the framework of 1 country 2 system, 
Hong Kong is going to be Israel of China.
Few think about this way, CCP makes sure they get no weapon.</p>
<p>Anyway, HK is valueless when it lose independence,
if they get ruled by mainlander,
whether CCP or another central government.</p>
<p>US know all about the above,
this is why the US Congress working on Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.
Note, it's in the Congress, councilors and senates from both parties show support of the Act,
once passed, it's not going to be changed by president re-election.</p>
<p>What if HK protester lose?</p>
<p>It's worse than before. 
Even police force can't avoid been look down by their mainlander boss.</p>
<p>It's hard to think clear when HK protester shocked by police brutalities.
You can't win by fighting police, no military training, no weapon,
no tactic advantages, no interests from the western world.</p>
<p>You can only be great if you can stand between the east and the west,
don't cheat yourself, push to the following steps:
freedom, democracy, rule of law, autonomy, independence.</p>
<p>Make it clear, fight again CCP, don't be trapped into the kill zone of 30k police force.</p>
<h1>Comments to Ming Ju Zheng's video</h1>
<p>Hong Kong people looks confused when they get hate by mainland.</p>
<p>It's wrong if you think Hong Kong people don't know who's their mainland fellows, vice versa.</p>
<p>Hong Kong (HK) can get good future only if she can stand independently between the west and the east.
If HK can't bridge between the 2 half-spheres, 
HK can't be more productive over Shenzhen or similar cities where slave factory lower the costs.</p>
<p>So, it's important to say: we fight China Communist Party (CCP) to save Hong Kong.
Know that your Five Demands can only beget from CCP,
don't cheat yourself any more, my dear HK citizens.</p>
<p>Make it clear you're going to fight for the freedom, 
be determined to fight the central government even if CCP collapse next year,
because it's Hong Kong's destiny to be a bridge between China and the western world.</p>
<p>In history, Hong Kong is a port. It became important after Opium war of 1840,
when British became the first global naval power after Napoleonic war in Europe,
when the dynasty of Qing failed to balance trade with the west.</p>
<p>Even if HK people like to make successful business only, without the political drama,
a degree of independence is a must, either fulfill the autonomy according the basic law or, 
to an extreme degree, fight for independence. 
USA know it, so they work on the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.</p>
<p>HK lacks chance to become Israel of China, but it's actually a good example.</p>
<p>Now, HK been trapped inside the kill zones of police force, 
blind by the hate to believe there are one billion mainlander want to kill HK people.
It's now, at the precise moment,  you get the challenge to become a great city,
but if you dare not even to speak: I'm fighting the evil and connect to the righteousness.
You're worthless, doomed to lose.</p>
<p>It's very important to stop cheating  yourself, 
you're fighting CCP.<br>
You make your real enemy laugh when you dare not to talk the truth, 
and now, ask yourself again: who satisfy your FIVE demands at last?</p>
<h1>Msg to Lucas Video</h1>
<p>Please let your friends in Hong Kong know that they MUST talk it clear
that they are fighting CCP, China Communist Party.</p>
<p>The 5 demands can only be achieved from CCP,
not Carrie LAM, not government of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The whole world is helping Hong Kong fighting CCP,
but what's going to happen if Hong Kong people dare not to 
talk the truth?</p>
<p>It's painful beaten by corrupted police,
but HongKongners' going to make their real enemy laugh
if they repeat yelling: Five Demands...
but dare not look straight to their real enemy.</p>
<p>I feel danger because CCP is going to be free to
pay more attention on HK after Oct. 1, do it now or never. </p>
<p>Please tell your HK friends if you think it's ok.</p>
<h1>comments on Glory to Hong Kong</h1>
<p>It's time to make it clear, you are anti-CCP and anti-totalitarian.</p>
<p>please speak out now
that you are fighting CCP, China Communist Party.</p>
<p>The 5 demands can only be granted by CCP,
not Carrie LAM, not government of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The whole world is helping Hong Kong fighting CCP,
but what's going to happen if Hong Kong people dare not to 
tell the truth?</p>
<p>It's painful beaten by corrupted police,
actually CCP control those batons.
Hong Kong people is going to make their real enemy laugh
if they repeat yelling: Five Demands...
but dare not look straight into their real enemy.</p>
<p>It become more danger because CCP is going to move ahead to
apply hard hands on HK after Oct. 1. Tell the truth now or never. </p>
<p>Good to let the whole world know chiNAZI coming to kill you 
instead of being tortured after they cut off internet,
push away all journalists, crash all cameras, 
drug 30k police to next level of brutality.
Then they brainwash you to love their abusive mindset,
forget all the struggles.</p>
<p>If you don't want all the bad things happen,
tell the truth at least before you lose the chance:
you are fighting CCP.</p>
<p>This is the only way to get 5 demands, not one less.</p>
<p>Put a simple word: chiNAZI, or NAZI 2.0
Then the whold word know pretty well how to help you.
If you keep crying against brutal police, 
let's think about it, such brutalities happen all over the world,
your foreigner friends lose focus how to help you.
And the 5 Demands confuse them, by no means give up the big 5,
instead hold up one of you hand express all the fingers,
but make it simple with one word: chiNAZI,
it NAZI 2.0.</p>
<p>They know immediately how to help: keep your communication,
keep freedom of speech, fight again brainwashing,
focus on human rights, send more journalists, 
fix their eyes on police brutalities,
watch out mainland military, and so on.</p>
<p>Don't use anti-chinazi, it's waste 4 letters and one symbol,
keep it short, cut off all the misleading information,
there're always some one who don't know what's ANTI-,
and alwasy someone get no time to read 4 more letters,
save all of your efforts to get help, 
it's a fighting against NAZI style oppression.
This might be a must to win the 5 demands, not one less.</p>
<p>Please think about it.</p>
