# 13.7 Billion years, 
## universe, Solar System, the Heavy Bombardment



    To see a World in a Grain of Sand
    And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,
    Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand
    And Eternity in an hour.

    -- Fragment from "Anguries of Innocence" 
       by William Blake


English is not my native language, but I can still feel the
beauty in his writing.

The world should be a real world, there should be mountains
and rivers, there should be forests and deserts, ice and
snows. There should be birds flying and fish swimming,
and there should be villages and people live in there.

In the grain of sand, there are plenty of stories happened long long
ago. And stories yet to happen that will happen long long
after, in the grain of sand.

Where is the grain of sand come from?

I think the big bang is kind of explain, and I know I am
stupid to think this way, the big bang is not start from a
grain of sand, although they both start from very small
thing. At first of big bang, it's far smaller then the grain
of sand, the size should be under Planck length, it's 
10(to the power of -35) meter, it means a billion of billion
of it will not get the length of a meter.


The beginning of our world is the big bang before 13.7
billion years.

But we can not see the big bang, not only because it's so
small but also because there was no light when it happened.

But inside the sand there was no concepts of big or small.

We are going to follow the events possibly happened during
the 14 billion years, if we dropped inside the sand.
Exactly, it's 13.799 +/- 0.021 billion years. Inside,
there is no thing as to be outside. Everything will be
inside the grain of sand, including time and space and all
that can exist in time and space. 

Suppose most of our understanding of God is inside too.

We think everything is inside, everything we loved and
everyone who love us should be inside the grain of sand,
if it's all of our world the initial universe, the sand.

At the beginning, the density and the temperature is
extremly high, when the big bang start. It started rapid
expanding and cooling.

The temperature and density fluctuate at extrem high level,
at about one-millionth second, quarks and gluons combined to
form baryons such as protons and neutrons. 


百万分之一秒时，
夸克和胶子结合成为诸如质子和中子的重子族。
之后宇宙的温度开始从极点降低，
不足以产生新的质子－反质子对、中子－反中子对。
从而导致了粒子和反粒子之间的质量湮灭，
原有的质子和中子仅有十亿分之一保留下来，
而对应的所有反粒子则全部湮灭。

大约在1秒之后，电子和正电子之间也发生了湮灭，
剩余的质子、中子和电子的速度降低到相对论范围以下，
此时的宇宙能量密度主要来自湮灭产生的光子。

20分钟左右，核合成完成，
产生了略重的原子核和它们的同位素，如氘元素、
氦的同位素3和4、锂的同位素6、7。
这个过程称为太初核合成，大约持续17分钟，
