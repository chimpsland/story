# 13.7 Billion years, 
## universe, Solar System, the Heavy Bombardment



    To see a World in a Grain of Sand
    And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,
    Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand
    And Eternity in an hour.

    -- Fragment from "Anguries of Innocence" 
       by William Blake



We can have a whole world in a grain of sand,
and put it in our palm of hand.
There are mountains and forests, grass lands and deserts,
there are winding rivers flow into oceans, 
stars shinning in the dark blue,
eyes see it from earth.
There are flowers in spring, leaves drop in autom.

In the grain of sand, there were stories occurred long long
before. And stories yet happened that will happen long long
after, in the grain of sand.

Where is the grain of sand come from?

It starts getting explained in physics, physicists
accumulated not enough facts until our humanbeings start to
fight the world wars. Until then scholars tried to find
something similar to the grain of sand when others found the
world wars couldn't break the world.  But what physicists
found out till now is very close to the old idea of God
creat the world.

The beginning of our world is the big bang before 13.7
billion years.

When the whole universe was as small as a grain of sand.
But inside the sand there was no concepts of big or small.

We are going to follow the events possibly happened during
the 14 billion years, if we dropped inside the sand.
Exactly, it's 13.799 +/- 0.021 billion years. Inside,
there is no thing as to be outside. Everything will be
inside the grain of sand, including time and space and all
that can exist in time and space. 

Suppose most of our understanding of God is inside too.

We think everything is inside, everything we loved and
everyone who love us should be inside the grain of sand,
if it's all of our world the initial universe, the sand.

At the beginning, the density and the temperature is
extremly high, when the big bang start. It started rapid
expanding and cooling.

The temperature and density fluctuate at extrem high level,
at about one-millionth second, quarks and gluons combined to
form baryons such as protons and neutrons. 


百万分之一秒时，
夸克和胶子结合成为诸如质子和中子的重子族。
之后宇宙的温度开始从极点降低，
不足以产生新的质子－反质子对、中子－反中子对。
从而导致了粒子和反粒子之间的质量湮灭，
原有的质子和中子仅有十亿分之一保留下来，
而对应的所有反粒子则全部湮灭。

大约在1秒之后，电子和正电子之间也发生了湮灭，
剩余的质子、中子和电子的速度降低到相对论范围以下，
此时的宇宙能量密度主要来自湮灭产生的光子。

20分钟左右，核合成完成，
产生了略重的原子核和它们的同位素，如氘元素、
氦的同位素3和4、锂的同位素6、7。
这个过程称为太初核合成，大约持续17分钟，
