September, 2019.
Hong Kong's protesters face hard choice,
to fight or yield.

One thing for sure, they can not push police to stop violence.

The protesters shock the world by a few big protests in peace,
millions people protested, among 7 million of Hong Kong's total population

    1  million, June 9.
    2  millions, June 16.
    1.7million, August 18.

After been denied from government,
more and more protesters turned into violent,
start to challenge riot police in front lines.

Police use iron hand on protesters, Roman army formation with full gear,
tear gas, rubber bullets, long shields and batons. They improved weapons and violence fastly,
but no improvement on fact checking or reasoning their brutalities.

Local people shout to police vehicles with: "HEI-GING". Which means corrupted police.

On 31 August, police denied another request for assemble.
Police arrested well known pro-democratic persons, including member of Legistive Council.
It marked start of police control society.

Now it turned into Sept 2, police saw good effects of their white terror.
It's white because it been said no kill no red terror. 

Zero killing?

People confused if they lost a few of their fellow citizens in subway station 
Prince Edward, the MTR station is mysterily closed for long time after riot police
rushed in and madly beat claimed-to-be riotors. 

Then they announced no dead.
But the CCTV inside the station is refused to be reviewed till now, Sept 3.

Then they proved they can at least beat a boy into deep unconscious,
in the same MTR station.
when many passengers proved the boy really posed no danger to any one,
They did video them with cameras on their mobile phones. 
If not so, a group of police would drag the body to nowhere nobody know in the night of Sept 2,
when people found the boy already lost conscious, 
and his whole body gave no physical reflexes when been dragged away like a rubbish bag,
people start to angrily yelled: "HEI-GING, HEI-GING..."

Hong Kong people paid less and less attention to their government leader,
Carrie Lam. They know she's controled by Beijin.

USA President Trump already mentioned Hong Kong many times, 
in front of jounalists and in his tweets, during the trade war.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel is going to visit Beijin, 
Hong Kong people managed to publish a letter of petition on German newpapers.

Who can save Hong Kong?

A letter in English appeared in one of protestors forum, LIHKG.com,

    A msg to HK's protesters: there's only one way you can win

It the only win is to send 5 million people to streets, peacefully.

Police already arrested over 1000 and denied quiet a few times the requests for peaceful assembly,
but still possible to get the next one.

So Hong Kong can still keep its freedom of speech, 
but loseing part of its freedom of assembly,
when can they do it?

Or can they decide to do it instead of to improve violence?

We quote the phrase for those suffered a lot in the frontline:

    For I was an hungred, and you gave me meat.
    I was thirsty, and you gave me drink.
    I was a stranger, and you took me in.
    Naked, and you clothed me. 
    I was sick, and you visited me.
    I was in prison, and you came unto me.

    -- Matthew 25:35

We wish to see it happen. 

And wish God bless Hong Kong.
