Hong Kong people dare not to use the word: ChiNAZI
==================================================


The word tell the truth, ChiNAZI.

Keep it short and simple, you must learn it is very important.

Glory to Hong Kong,
When the song got just thousands views on Youtube,
I work hard to let people learn why they need sing the song,
because it's one of your powerful weapons, voice from hearts.

Your enemy didn't realise why they get terrible hurts by a song.

Now the word, ChiNAZI, causes many voices against it.
Why? Because your enemy is afraid of it. 

Some people said ChiNAZI would stir up German's bad memories.
Why? Don't you think Germans can think clear about their own history?

Same as the song, use the word: ChiNAZI. It's another powerful weapon.
If you worry about people mis-unstanding you supporting of NAZI,
give it a big NO, make NO ChiNAZI.

Or give it a big cross, X ChiNAZI.
This is also good: No Nazi 2.0

If you use something like: AntiTotalitarian, AntiAuthoritarian,
AntiChinazi ......

Are you going to present the world a great academic lecture by protest 100 thousands citizen assembly?
Teach them what's ANTI, what's definition of authoritarian and how big brother
brainwash so many mainland people to quench your protest and pretent to be
righteous, but people just can't get it.

You have to be Israel of China, 
not for rebellion, but for righteousness and humane rights.

At last, do you know how people read long words? They don't read it at all.
