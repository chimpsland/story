## China history in ? minutes

China is the 2nd largest economy in the world now, and it
could become the 1st. 

It's about 1500 BC, when ancient Chinese people invented Chinese writtings,
Some teachers would put the Chinese history a few
thousands years before the date, it's not a big difference if we study
human history for a million years, yes we came to exists so
long ago.

So in China Shang and Zhou was the 2 dynasties got degree of writing
records. Then followed by long seasons of spring and autum, war
states kept fighting each other, and at last the first
emperor of dynasty Qin came, literally he named himself The first Emperor.

What's really important is he set up strong central ruling system
for Chinese from now on, We can call it
totalitarian or dictatorship, but those words not exists
those days. 

It's a pyramid in human society, but Chinese people didn't
know pyramids either, and Egyptians already gave up pyramid
building those days.

After dynasty of Qin, 
there were similar dynasties of
Han, Sui, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, Qing. One follow the
before, emperors had theories say why they destroy the same
dynasty before them, and people always dare not to not
believe them. It's a cycling game of chimpanzee climbing up the
pyramid.

During those dynasties, they kept a system
castrating men, from dynasty Song, the society kept it as culture to
broken women's feet physically.

When it turned into Qing,
British won the war of opium in 1842, it made Dynasty of Qing
start to collapse, the process was very slow and many got killed during it.

in 1882 USA past Chinses Exclusion Act, Act like this really curbed
Chinese inside the hell.

it was terrible for Chineses and let's put it 1 and a half
century after the event, it's shameful for all kind of
humanbeens.

In 1908 USA Congress passed a bill and president
Theodore Roosevelt started the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship
program, yes, this balanced the feeling of history of
Chinese exclusion Act.

Qing ended in 1911 

So can we simplify Chinese history as from Qin to Qing? 

No, history didn't stop there, communist party get hands on China from 1949,
they get good theory about why they rule the people, but
actually, it's still a game of chimpanzees and 
the pyramid.

immedially, communists start to kill land-owners and their
families, by millions. 

Chinese and Americans fight during the Korean War, but Chinese solider denied
they were send by China government, they call themself
volunteers.

After the Korean war, communists turned inside to kill over 30 million Chinese by
starvation from 1959-61. 

Then they tested nuclear weapon in Oct. 1964, 
After they got the big bombs, Mao 
and his communists comrades start to torture more Chinese by
another political movement, it's been called The Great Culture Revolution.
Actually it's torturings and killings in great numbers.

To be comparable, USA went to land on the Moon in 1969, 
Steve Jobs start to sell Apple computers in 1976, when
communists kept killing all these periods.

When the power transferred from Mao to Deng with a series of
struggles, China Communists start to use markets, it's
period been called reforming and opening, it's market but
not a free market. 

1989 it seen killing in Beijin, Tian-An-Men square, after it,
German people broke down the Berlin wall.

1999 it seen start of persecutions and mass torturing of Fa-Lun-Gong practioners.

Then people learnt the business of human organ transplant.

2001 China joined WTO, it's export really start to booming.

In the same time, they kept strong hands on birth control,
Some people think it's just pregnant abortion but
how they do it? push women onto the table and pull the flesh
out of their body. 

Okay, who killed the most Chinese and how?

They kill too much, they did the killing publically or
secretly, they did it revolutionally or anyway, they achive
it in time of Internet.

But the market and trading brought China to the position of
2nd economic volume, and shows the boundary of free market
it's non-free-market. The communist party members become the
biggest benefitted group, together with their families and
friends they have the number of hundreds million, and enjoy
the billion Chinese. They twisted the history and brain-wash
people in time of Internet and iPhone.

Should people fight back?

Yes, but definitally we don't want hate and we don't want
killing.

Why they kill so much?

The reason is the pyramid, the chimpanzee climbing on the
pyramid.

But among all of it China became the second economy.

they re-invent the Internet by splitting it, there are at
least 2 internets, one is your Internet and another one is Chinese
Internet. 

There is an ghost wall between the 2 Internet, it's part of
brain washing process to turn inocent Chinese unknow the
truch  history and start to fight again the rest of the world.

The technics to build up the ghost wall is as followings:
to block IP network addresses, pollute DNS servers,
filter and forbid URLs, reset TCP connections, 
screen and drop data packets, attact as man-in-middle,
block VPN servers, manupulate zombee computers,
inspect content with AI learning and persecute anyone who
tell the truth.

All of the techniques used by the ghost wall can be defeated by
software and hardware approaches, it's cost will be far less
than a tariff war between China and USA. But who's going to
pay for it?

Now it's going to see many trading conflicts between free
world and China, we already know your leaders will
manupulate it to keep friendship with China Chimps, and we
know you can get good number of bribes and balance the
import/export finance sheet.

30 years has past since 40th president Ronald Reagan once
called to Mr. Gorbachev: Please tear down this wall.

The simple sentance is one of the reasons we respect history studies,
the human history should be about humanity. 

And it's profitable to tear down the ghost wall. It costs far
less than a trading conflict. 

keep passing data on
Internet help companies run their business, and when people
learn the truth they stop hating and killing,
it one of the reason we like Internet.

You can get jobs back from slave
factories but don't blame the slaves, they got pushing down
and nailed onto the ground by Chimps and pyramid of power, 
by tearing down the wall you can return help to more slaves.

We know those Chimps is goiing to find friendship from your
people, but inside the pyramid we dare not to tell the Chimp the simple words:
stop torturing and stop killing.

They killed too much, 
stop killing, give up revenge, don't kill back, 

If you know it now,
help to tear down the ghost wall.




ddd
And it stands today, it's China, the country, the pyramid,
the central power facing the world, no matter it been called
the emperor, the dynasty or communism.


How many had lost their life? The number
would be hard for average people to believe, it's countless, and they
systematically deleted and hide the documents, but the
unit is million. Over 100M got
physically abused, tortured, they were not killed  by executions, they
got killed by
their families and friends, who were forced to do it in managed
processes of political involvements.

If you are going to face China, you are going to face a
pyramid over 2 thousands years.


But Chinese people don't know the pyramid, they don't know
history because big brother twisted the hisotry.

if you can get the bribe from communists, please use
1% of it to break the Ghost Wall. 

Please recall the man's calling: tear down the wall!

If you want one thing more than the money, please tear down
the wall. It can secure your a position in history of
humanity, you need not pay for it, let Chinese pay for it,
use the profit of the tariff war to pay for it, 1% is
far more then enough.
